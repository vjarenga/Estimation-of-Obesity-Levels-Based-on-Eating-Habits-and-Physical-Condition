# Estimation of Obesity Levels Based on Eating Habits and Physical Condition
This project aims to analyze a dataset comprising health and dietary information from individuals in Mexico, Peru, and Colombia to predict obesity levels. By leveraging Python for data analysis and machine learning, the project will explore relationships between physical conditions, eating habits, and obesity, ultimately developing predictive models to estimate obesity levels based on these factors.

# Conclusion
At the end of this project, it is evident that obesity levels can be effectively predicted using eating habits, physical activity, and other health-related factors.
Random Forest was identified as the best model for this task due to its high performance across all evaluation metrics.

# Recommendations
Adopt Random Forest for Prediction:

Deploy the Random Forest model for practical applications in predicting obesity levels.
Ensure hyperparameter optimization to maintain its high performance.

Awareness Programs:

Leverage insights about obesity-related factors to design targeted health awareness campaigns.
Encourage healthier eating habits and increased physical activity, especially among younger demographics.

Future Improvements:

Explore ensemble methods or deep learning models to further enhance prediction accuracy.
Conduct longitudinal studies to examine how obesity levels change over time with lifestyle modifications.
